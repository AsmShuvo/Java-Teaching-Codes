Problem: Shape Calculator
Create an abstract class `Shape` for a basic shape calculator that supports different shapes like circles and rectangles.

Requirements:
Create an abstract class `Shape` with:
    An abstract method `calculateArea()` that returns a double.
    An instance variable `name` initialized by constructor
    A concrete method `display()` that prints the shape's name and area.
Create two concrete classes:
    `Circle` with a radius variable and `calculateArea()` returning π * radius².
    `Rectangle` with length and width variables and `calculateArea()` returning length * width.
In a `Main` class, create one `Circle` and one `Rectangle`, then call `display()` on both
