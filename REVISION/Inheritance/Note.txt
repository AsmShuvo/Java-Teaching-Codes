1. What is inheritance in Java?
Answer:
Inheritance is a mechanism where one class (child/subclass) acquires the properties and behaviors (fields and methods) of another class (parent/superclass).

Example:
class Animal {
    void eat() { System.out.println("This animal eats."); }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() { System.out.println("Dog barks."); }
}
Now, Dog inherits the eat() method from Animal.
